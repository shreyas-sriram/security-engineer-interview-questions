## Questions
United States Security Engineer interview questions scraped from Glassdoor.

The scraper runs (hopefully) every Sunday at 1337 (:skull_and_crossbones:). If it doesn't, blame GitHub Action. Pun intended.

> Note: This is quite a hacky solution, not gonna deny that. If Glassdoor changes the webpage structure, this is gonna break.

## TODO
- [ ] Parse JSON data and show on a static webpage with filtering, searching etc.
- [ ] Scraped data is too raw and requires some cleaning. Example, question data like **"cannot discuss due to NDA"** can be filtered.

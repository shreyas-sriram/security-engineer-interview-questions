<details><summary>What interests you in working in software development?</summary>
<p>

- I got into coding during the summer of 2020 when my internship had been cancelled, and I started to love working on my own mini projects while learning how to code at the same time. I like the work flow of designing, drafting, troubleshooting and then iterating on your work to add features and make it more efficient. Each design challenge is like a puzzle that I get great enjoyment from solving. Working on bigger, more collaborative projects would be beneficial to me as I could improve my understanding of best principles for designing the architecture of a software. Less

<details><summary>If you had a million dollar to fix a vulnerability class, which one would you choose and why?</summary>
<p>

- Heap based buffer overflows. I’d like to research mitigations that are backward-compatible with the C standard and that don’t require changes to an existing code base. Similar to canaries on the stack. I’d choose that, because this vuln class is frequently exploited and C is not going away any time soon although it’s so old. Less

- A vulnerability in a web server that exists due to a lack of malicious user input detection, sanitation, and validation checks. SSRF vulnerabilities don't validate the user provided URL endpoints before processing/calling the URL endpoints. This allows a bad-actor to make requests to bogon IP addresses (127.0.0.1, 169.254.0.0/16, fe80::1, etc) which often can force the web server to reveal sensitive data and website administration pages that only run on localhost to a bad-actor on the public internet.

<details><summary>How would you design an audit logger?</summary>
<p>

- This is a systems design interview question, so if you know about micro-service architecture, databases, scaling, and caching, that would be relatively enough to answer it. Less
- There's a lot of elements to typically cover in these questions, clarifications, scoping, making sure you're answering the actual question the interviewer is looking for you to answer, etc.


Could be worth doing a mock interview with one of the Prepfully DigitalOcean  Security Engineer experts... they've worked in the role so they clearly know how to get through the interview.

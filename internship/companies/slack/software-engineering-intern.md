# Software Engineering Internship (Summer 2022), Slack

> 09-07-2021

## We are looking for interns who will demonstrate:

- A strong work ethic, and an eagerness to jump in and help fix things
- Curiosity about how things work and tenacity to learn
- Self-awareness and a desire to improve your skills
- Strong communication skills, a positive attitude, and empathy

## You will work in one of the following areas:

## BACKEND

Our team works to create delightful features, while designing and implementing useful API methods to improve the reliability of our systems. We build our app using reliable tools that our team knows and trusts, including Hack/PHP, MySQL, and Linux. Expertise in these areas is a huge plus, but having a familiarity with other common web languages (such as Python or Ruby) and other relational databases are fine substitutes.

## CLIENT ENGINEERING (WEB FRONTEND, ANDROID, AND IOS)

You will use React / Javascript / CSS (Web Frontend), Java / Kotlin (Android), or Objective-C / Swift (iOS) to improve the Slack clients, complex in-browser and native applications relied upon by millions of users every day. You will work with real-time data streams, engineer for performance across browsers, and delight people by making the best software we can imagine. You will work closely with Product, Design, Backend, and QA to build, test and deploy new features.

## DESKTOP

Everyday, millions of people use Slack's desktop application to stay connected and communicate with their teams. Though the application is used by a massive audience, it's created by a surprisingly small group of folks. We're able to pull this off through the use of cross-platform technologies like Electron, Node.js, and React. It doesn't hurt that our engineers are incredibly passionate and talented. Come help us build delightful features and tackle the unique challenges of developing for Windows, macOS, and Linux using web technologies.

## INFRASTRUCTURE

Come help make Slack be more performant and reliable for teams of any size around the world. Our team focuses on the building blocks that enable the product engineering teams to build features easier, faster and more reliably. We'll use your knowledge of data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, operating systems, and networking to build and troubleshoot complex distributed systems.

## CLOUD ENGINEERING

The Cloud Engineering team is responsible for building the network, systems, and software upon which we build Slack. We are a team of tool builders working to provide a secure and reliable base powered by automation. We use Chef, Python, MySQL, memcached, Solr, Apache, Kubernetes, HHVM, Java, Go, and many other technologies, all running in AWS and GCP.

## DATA

The Data team helps our analysts, product managers, and customers understand how to make our users’ working lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. We develop Slack's open-source data infrastructure built on top of Thrift, Kafka, Spark, Druid, Airflow and Vitess and the work will involve creating and scaling batched streaming data pipelines.

## AUTOMATION QA

You will develop frameworks, tools, and tests to cover the full depth and breadth of Slack’s client-server-side functionality. This includes our desktop and web clients, our iOS and Android clients, our external service integrations, the Slack platform API, and our supporting server infrastructure.

## SECURITY

The Security team at Slack partners with other teams to ensure we are doing our best work to protect customer data. We partner with each Slack engineering team to ensure Slack's entire product stack considers security best practices. We monitor Slack's operating environments, looking for malware and bad actors on Slack's corporate and production infrastructure. We develop secure libraries, tools, and services to prevent classes of risk and vulnerabilities to support Slack's operating environment. We continuously assess Slack's compliance with security standards and best practices. Help protect the billions of messages that Slack users share on our platform.
